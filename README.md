# Book-shop
We have written an online store project. Where there are books with titles, authors, price and age category.
 There are 6 functions in our online store:
    1) View all available books.
	2) View the shopping cart that contains the books you want to purchase, their quantity and total cost.
	3) Adding books to the cart.
	4) Removing books from the trash.
	5) The ability to search for a book with a keyword through the title of the book and the author's name.
	6) Completing the purchase and purchase of the book.

Instruction to use:
	To use the site, you need to choose one of six choices.
	*To view the available books, select 1.
	*To view your shopping cart (the list and the number of books you have selected at the moment), press 2.
	*If you selected add/remove books from the trash,
	specify their numbers and you can separate the numbers as you want (separated by a dot, comma, space, or even letters).
	Select 3 to add books, select 4 to remove books;
	*If you have selected 5 and want to find a book by title or by the author's name, write it.
	*If you have made a purchase and want to stop the program and make a payment, then press 6.
Any assumptions or limitations
	There are only 5 books in our store. To make it convenient to test, but you can work with up to 10,000 books or more.
	The program uses a switch to select an action, and uses all the principles of OOP to search, delete, add books.
	An array was used to store the data.
